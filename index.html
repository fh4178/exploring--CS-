  <p>Hello world, what is up? MY name is <b>Bob</b> AND <u>I LIKE CHEESE!</u> Other than that, there is nothing else you need to know, or is there? I guess you will never know. </p>
  <p> <font color="orange">So I am here today to talk about cheese. <b>CHEESE</b>. <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/pronunciation/english/cheese">pronounced <b>CH-EE-S</a>. Not CH-EE-S-EH</b>. Many people mess that up and it is <b>NOT</b> ok. There are many different types of good cheeses. But I like the best two are mozzarella and parmesan cheese. They are the best!</font>
